\section{The space \texorpdfstring{\(\mathcal{C}^0\)}{C0}}
\begin{definition}
    \(\{f_n\}\) sequence in \(\mathcal{C}^0(\left[a, b\right])\). 
    We say that \(\{f_n\}\) is \textbf{uniformly equicontinuous} in \([a, b]\) if \(\forall \; \epsilon >0 \; \exists \; \delta >0 \) depending only on \(\epsilon \) s.t. 
    \[
        |t-\tau| < \delta \Rightarrow \| f_n(t) - f_n(\tau) \| < \epsilon \qquad \forall \; n
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    With respect to the uniform continuity, in this case \(\delta\) does not depend on \(f\). \(\delta\) is the same for all the \(f_n\) s
\end{remark}
\subsection{Ascolì-Arzela's theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Ascolì Arzelà]
    \(\{f_n\} \subseteq \mathcal{C}^0(\left[a, b\right])\). Suppose that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\{f_n\}\) is uniformly equicontinuous
        \item \(\{f_n\}\) is equibounded: \(\exists \; M>0\) s.t. \(\norm{f_n}_\infty <M \qquad \forall \; n\)
    \end{itemize}
    Then \(\exists\) a subsequence \(\{f_{n_k}\}\) and \(f \in \mathcal{C}^0(\left[a, b\right])\) s.t. \(f_{n_k} \rightarrow f \) uniformly.
\end{theorem}
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\(\mathcal{C}^0\)}{C0} is a separable space}
For instance, \((L^{\infty}, \normdot_{\infty})\) is not separable. Instead, \((\mathcal{C}^0([a,b]), \normdot_{\infty})\) is a separable space. 

\begin{proof}[Sketch of the proof]
    We will use the \textbf{Stone-Weierstrass theorem}.

    The set of polynomials is dense on \(\mathcal{C}^0([a,b])\) and is an uncountable set. 
    However, it can be proved that the set of polynomials with coefficients in \(\mathbb{Q}\) is dense in the set of all polynomials

    Moreover, this set is countable. Then, by Stone-Weierstrass this is a countable dense set in \(\mathcal{C}^0([a,b])\)
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
    One can show that \(\mathcal{C}^0(K)\) is separable whenever \(K\) is a compact set of a metric space \((X,d)\)
\end{remark}
